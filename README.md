# Advent of code 2024

This is my repository for the Advent of Code 2024. I will be solving the puzzles in [Dosato](https://github.com/Robotnik08/cdosato).
<br>

## Context

Dosato is a programming language that I created. It is a unique and robust intepreted language designed for the general purpose. It is a high-level language that is easy to learn and use. It is a dynamically typed language (with support for static typing) that supports both functional and object-oriented programming paradigms. It is a language that is designed to be easy to read and write.
<br>

The goal of this repository is to solve the puzzles in Dosato. I will be solving the puzzles in the order that they are released. I will be posting my solutions in this repository. I will also be posting the input files for each puzzle in this repository. 

### Why Dosato?

This is mainly because I want to test the robustness of the Dosato language, and see how well it can handle complex problems.


## How to run the code

To run the code, you will need to have the Dosato interpreter installed on your machine. You can download the Dosato interpreter [here](https://github.com/Robotnik08/cdosato). Once you have the Dosato interpreter installed, you can run the code by typing the following command in the terminal:

```
dosato <filename>
```

Where `<filename>` is the name of the Dosato file that you want to run. For example, if you want to run the code in the file `day1.to`, you would type the following command in the terminal:

```bash
dosato day1.to
```

Thats it really. I hope you enjoy the solutions. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or suggestions. I am always happy to help.
