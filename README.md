# Advent of code 2024

This is my repository for the Advent of Code 2024. I will be solving the puzzles in [Dosato](https://github.com/Robotnik08/cdosato).
<br>

## Context

Dosato is a programming language that I created. It is a unique and robust intepreted language designed for the general purpose. It is a high-level language that is easy to learn and use. It is a dynamically typed language (with support for static typing) that supports both functional and object-oriented programming paradigms. It is a language that is designed to be easy to read and write.
<br>

The goal of this repository is to solve the puzzles in Dosato. I will be solving the puzzles in the order that they are released. I will be posting my solutions in this repository. I will also be posting the input files for each puzzle in this repository. 

### Why Dosato?

This is mainly because I want to test the robustness of the Dosato language, and see how well it can handle complex problems.


## How to run the code

To run the code, you will need to have the Dosato interpreter installed on your machine. You can download the Dosato interpreter [here](https://github.com/Robotnik08/cdosato). Once you have the Dosato interpreter installed, you can run the code by typing the following command in the terminal:

```
dosato <filename>
```

Where `<filename>` is the name of the Dosato file that you want to run. For example, if you want to run the code in the file `day1.to`, you would type the following command in the terminal:

```bash
dosato day1.to
```

Thats it really. I hope you enjoy the solutions. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or suggestions. I am always happy to help.


## Log


- [x] Day 1
    - [x] Part 1
        - The solution for part 1 was pretty simple compared to last year. I did have an unrelated problem with a bug I found in the Dosato interpreter. I had to fix that before I could continue. The solution was pretty simple.
    - [x] Part 2
        - The solution for part 2 was also pretty simple. All in all I used 2 one liners to solve both problems. I am happy with the solution.
- [x] Day 2
    - [x] Part 1
        - Part 1 was cool.
    - [x] Part 2
        - The solution of Part 1 could be reused for Part 2, I used the brute force approach to solve the problem.
- [x] Day 3
    - [x] Part 1
        - Part 1 was pretty easy, my programming language building skills taught me a lot about parsing expressions like that. I found a bug in the stringSplit function, which I took care of, making it an easy solution
    - [x] Part 2
        - It was incredebly easy to modify part 1 to also give the answer for part 2, it took me less then 5 minutes
